# makebtreedb

```
Usage of ./makebtreedb:
  -d string
        records dir (default "dir")
  -i string
        db file (default "input")
```

this program will modify a btreedb5 file, according to records in the specific dir(format is same as those in `dumpbtreedb`, no useless files).

as i do not really know how starbound hash things, so the only thing you can do with this util is, modify records dumped by `dumpbtreedb` and repacked it back.
